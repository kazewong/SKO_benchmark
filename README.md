# Send Kaze to Olympics dataset and benchmarking code

This repository contains a small amount of data and associated benchmarking code for the project Send Kaze to Olympics (SKO).

## Some properties of the dataset

Existing common benchmarks are often very well curated and can easily interface with deep learning projects seemlessly. 

Here is a list of properties I think it is associated with the dataset linked in this repo:

1. Low data
2. Fast moving object
3. Changing size
4. Imperfect lighting
5. Unusual representation of a common object

## Tasks
